          <strong>Charles John Quarto</strong> is a mystic spiritual master, healer, psychic, poet, songwriter, philosopher, ally and advisor, on all matters vast. He began his performing career as a poet in Greenwich Village (his
          birthplace) in 1968. He performed on the David Frost Show, the Museum of Modern Art, New York
          University, the New York Folklore Center, the Bitter End, the Gaslight (his home club), and myriad other
          venues between September 1968 and June 1970. His poetry first appeared in the liner notes of one of
          Jerry Jeff Walker’s first albums. During his 18-month tenure in New York, Joni Mitchell befriended him
          and brought him to the attention of Graham Nash, who subsequently invited Charles John to move to
          Los Angeles and record his first album of poetry – <em>Charles John Quarto</em> (Atlantic Records) – which Graham kindly produced. Charles John then wrote album cover poems for Steven Stills and Rita
          Coolidge. Charles John then took up residence at the Chateau Marmont Hotel and performed at such
          places as the Hollywood Bowl, the Troubadour, McCabe’s Guitar Shop, the Improv, the Los Angeles
          Music Expo, and various other key spots in California.
        </p>

        <p>
          During late December of 1971, Michael Martin Murphey invited Charles John to go on tour in Texas, and
          this hejira led him to Austin where he took up residence from 1972 until June of 1973. While in Austin,
          he performed at South By Southwest, the Armadillo World Headquarters, the Saxon Pub, the Kerrville
          Folk Festival (where he was named lifetime poet laureate), the Hill on the Moon, the University of Texas,
          and many other colleges, clubs and festivals. It was in the Lone Star state that he began to write songs,
          with a growing list of skilled compadres. His first two co-written songs were “Rainbow Man” and
          “Geronimo’s Cadillac” with Michael Martin Murphey, which to date has been recorded 28 times. As in
          New York and California, Charles John’s reputation as a psychic healer and spiritual master continued to
          expand and he began to further comprehend his life’s purpose in this incarnation: to demonstrate
          human multidimensionality. After accepting a hobo scholarship for the summer of 1973 at the Fifth
          Avenue Hotel in New York, Charles John moved to Denver to become a snow leopard. While in
          Colorado, he performed at the Hotel Oxford, the Denver Folklore Center, the Rocky Mountain Summer
          Festivals, the Wilderness Society’s concert series, Ebbett’s Field, the Aspen Spring Festival, Colorado
          Women’s College, and the Athena Artists series. His lyric “Grapes on the Vine” was written on mountain
          roads and was welcomed on Randy Handley’s first album cover, and a few years later was cradled in
          music by the gifted Steve Gillette. Simultaneously, Charles John was touring, playing hundreds of
          colleges, clubs and concerts, throughout America, and sculpted a niche for himself with his work ethic
          and bohemian charm.
        </p>

        <p>
          In January 1975 Charles John returned to Los Angeles where he thrived in his spiritual and psychic work,
          his poetry and songwriting, and keened a golden reputation as a rainbow repairman. More and more
          people were seeking him out as a sage, as his life became more and more mystical with divine visitation,
          interactive communication with other species, and further and further demonstration of the Law of
          Divine Design, and how all human experience has loving cause and result. During his second tenure in
          California, he performed at further venues as a poet, was frequently a guest lecturer at the Los Angeles
          Music Expo, and began to write songs with a wider range of brilliant singers and musicians, and initiated
          a weekly gathering of great art and performance with a select group of contemporary creators who
          would later come to be known as “The Old Gang of Hearts.” Every Monday evening at the home of poet
          Mark Keller and the flawlessly lucid Wendy Webb, there were evenings of stellar wonder with Mark and
          Wendy, Steve Gillette, Randy Handley, Pete Wasner, Allan Thomas, Severin Browne, Doug Gittings,
          Scotty Galbraith, Dan Navarro, John Townsend and Salet Handley. The reason Charles John coordinated these evenings was for the energy of rare community and also to inspire each of the artists to create
          new wonder every week as equal parts of a pure team of Light.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          During his final Los Angeles years, Charles John began attracting hundreds of spiritual students, and his
          metaphysical abilities continued to multiply in grace and verisimilitude. He would frequently spend his
          days at Paramahansa’s Lake Shrine and his evenings in the kind shadow of Swami Muktanandah, before
          returning to his poetry cubicle in West Hollywood. He wrote voluminously and began to sense his exit
          strategy. In 1984 he put his guitar and thirteen boxes of writing on an Austin-bound Amtrak and shed
          California for the giant tenderness of Austin once again. His dear compatriots Susan and Jerry Jeff
          Walker donated their guest house to him for the sake of art. He roamed the green rolling hills on paper
          for the next two years, until he drifted north to Nashville in 1986 and subsequently recorded his second
          album of poetry – <em>Hobo Carousel</em> (RCA) – with musical support from Vince Gill, John Hartford, John Jarvis, Mike Henderson, Pete Wasner and Richard Bennett. This album was produced by Bill Halverson
          (who also produced <em>Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, Cream,</em> and <em>Keith Jarrett</em>). Bill and Charles John also have recently partnered again, for another project soon to be released. During the next eight years Charles John studied with the Archangel Michael and has been channeling Michael ever since.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the next nine years, Charles John was graced in his solitude and tunneled into the vast silence that
          music and poetry use as building blocks in the construction of peace.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently Charles John is releasing <em>The Rainbow Over Time,</em> a 30-song CD compendium of his co-written songs. He also has a new book of poems, simply entitled <em>Poems</em>.
